This file lists current "TODO" items for the JIT Drupal Module

* implement the 'request' action in spacetree
	- allows additional tree nodes to be added dynamically via ajax request
		instead of sending the entire tree at onceâ€“better performance!

* develop views integration
	- while useful in the current form for other module developers,
		this module becomes especially useful when it can render views that
		are set up through the views interface.

* implement other JIT visualizations
	- currently only SpaceTree and ForceDirected implemented
